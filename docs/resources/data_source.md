  sensitive = true
}

resource "propel_data_source" "my_data_source" {
  unique_name = "My Snowflake Data Source"
  description = "This is an example of a Snowflake Data Source"
  type        = "SNOWFLAKE"

  snowflake_connection_settings {
    account   = "Snowflake Account"
    database  = "Snowflake Database"
    warehouse = "Snowflake Warehouse"
    schema    = "Snowflake Schema"
    role      = "Snowflake Role"
