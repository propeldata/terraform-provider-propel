# propel_data_source (Resource)

Provides a Propel Data Source resource. This can be used to create and manage Propel Data Sources.

## Example Usage

### Snowflake Data Source

```terraform
variable "snowflake_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

resource "propel_data_source" "my_data_source" {
  unique_name = "My Snowflake Data Source"
  description = "This is an example of a Snowflake Data Source"
  type        = "SNOWFLAKE"

  snowflake_connection_settings {
    account   = "Snowflake Account"
    database  = "Snowflake Database"
    warehouse = "Snowflake Warehouse"
    schema    = "Snowflake Schema"
    role      = "Snowflake Role"
    username  = "Snowflake Username"
    password  = var.snowflake_password
  }
}
```

### Webhook Data Source

The Webhook Data Source will automatically create a Data Pool with the same name and schema.

```terraform
variable "http_basic_auth_password" {
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

resource "propel_data_source" "my_webhook_data_source" {
  unique_name = "MyWebhookDataPool"
  description = "This is an example of a Webhook Data Source"
  type        = "WEBHOOK"

  webhook_connection_settings {
    timestamp = "event_timestamp"
    unique_id = "event_id"
    tenant = "customer_id"

    column {
      name = "event_id"
      type = "STRING"
      nullable = false
      json_property = "event_id"
    }

    column {
      name = "customer_id"
      type = "STRING"
      nullable = false
      json_property = "customer_id"
    }

    column {
      name = "event_timestamp"
      type = "TIMESTAMP"
      nullable = false
      json_property = "event_timestamp"
    }

    column {
      name = "customer_name"
      type = "STRING"
      nullable = true
      json_property = "customer_name"
    }

    basic_auth {
      username = "foo"
      password = var.http_basic_auth_password
    }
  }
}
```

### Nested Schema for `http_connection_settings`

Optional:

- `basic_auth` (Block List, Max: 1) The HTTP Basic authentication settings for uploading new data.

If this parameter is not provided, anyone with the URL to your tables will be able to upload data. While it's OK to test without HTTP Basic authentication, we recommend enabling it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--http_connection_settings--basic_auth))

<a id="nestedblock--http_connection_settings--basic_auth"></a>
### Nested Schema for `http_connection_settings.basic_auth`

Required:

- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password for HTTP Basic authentication that must be included in the Authorization header when uploading new data.
- `username` (String) The username for HTTP Basic authentication that must be included in the Authorization header when uploading new data.



<a id="nestedblock--s3_connection_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `s3_connection_settings`

- `aws_access_key_id` (String) The AWS access key ID for an IAM user with sufficient access to the S3 bucket.
- `aws_secret_access_key` (String, Sensitive) The AWS secret access key for an IAM user with sufficient access to the S3 bucket.
- `bucket` (String) The name of the S3 bucket.


<a id="nestedblock--snowflake_connection_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `snowflake_connection_settings`
